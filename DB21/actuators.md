## Actuators - Introduction

What are Actuators?

Actuators are devices that convert electrical signals into physical movement. 
They are the muscles of a robot, enabling it to interact with and manipulate its environment. 

In the context of robotics, actuators are used to create motion, apply force, and perform actions. 
They receive commands from the robot's control system and translate them into mechanical movements.

Let's take a simple example from our real world.
Imagine that you are turning the steering wheel of a car. 
Your hands act as actuators that move the wheel, controlling the direction of the car. 
In this scenario, your hands are receiving signals from your brain and converting them into the physical action of steering.

Actuators are essential for a robot's functionality, enabling it to perform tasks such as moving, lifting, rotating, and gripping objects. They allow the robot to interact dynamically with its environment and execute the tasks it was designed for.

Let's proceed to understand the various actuators equipped on the Duckiebot DB21J robot.

## Actuators on Duckiebot DB21J

### Motors

#### Description

Motors are devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical motion.
The Duckiebot DB21J is equipped with DC motors.
These motors drive the wheels of the robot, allowing it to move forward, backward, and turn.

#### Working Principle

DC motors work by converting direct current electrical energy into rotational mechanical energy through the interaction of magnetic fields. 
When electrical current passes through the motor's coils, it generates a magnetic field. 
This magnetic field interacts with the fixed magnets inside the motor, causing the motor's shaft to rotate. 
By controlling the direction and amount of current, the speed and direction of the motor's rotation can be precisely controlled.

#### Usage Example

Motors are fundamental for the movement and operation of the Duckiebot. They provide the following capabilities:

- Driving the wheels to move the robot in different directions.
- Controlling the speed of the robot by adjusting the power supplied to the motors.
- Executing complex driving patterns such as turning, reversing, and following a trajectory could be achieved by controlling the motors.
