    <a href="sensors.md#encoders">
        <img src="images/encoder.jpg" alt="Encoders" title="Encoders">
    </a>
    </div>
    
    We will discuss how each sensor contributes to the robot’s ability to perceive and interact with its environment.

2. [Actuators](actuators.md)

    This section covers the different actuators equipped on the robot like motors, LED's and an OLED display.

    <div id="actuator_icons" align="center">
    <a href="actuators.md#motors">
        <img src="images/motor.jpg" alt="Motor" title="Motor">
    </a>
    </div>
    
    These actuators are responsible for the robot’s movement and interaction with the environment.

3. [Computing](computing.md)

    This section covers the computing unit equipped on the robot like the Jetson Nano and the Duckiehut.

    <div id="computing_icons" align="center">
    <a href="computing.md#jetson-nano">
        <img src="images/jetson_nano.jpg" alt="Jetson Nano" title="Jetson Nano">
    </a>
    </div>
    
    The computing unit is the brain of the robot and is responsible for processing sensor data, making decisions, executing control algorithms, moving the actuators, etc.

4. [Power](power.md)

    This section covers the power system equipped on the robot like batteries, power management components, etc.

    <div id="power_icons" align="center">
    <a href="power.md#duckiebattery">
        <img src="images/duckiebattery.jpg" alt="DuckieBattery" title="DuckieBattery">
    </a>
    </div>
    
    We will discuss the Smart Duckiebattery, its capacity, and how it supports the robot’s energy needs.
