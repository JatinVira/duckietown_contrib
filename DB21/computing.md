## Computing - Introduction

What is Computing? And Why do we need an onboard computer in a robot?

Computing in robotics involves the processing of data, decision-making, and control. 
It is the brain of a robot, handling everything from sensor data processing to executing complex algorithms for navigation and interaction.

In the context of robotics, computing systems are responsible for:

- Interpreting data from sensors and making decisions based on that data.
- Controlling actuators to perform desired actions.
- Running software that allows the robot to execute tasks autonomously.

Let's take a simple example from our real world.
Imagine you are driving a car using GPS navigation. 
Your brain processes information from the GPS, road signs, and your surroundings to make decisions about where to go and how to drive. 
In this scenario, your brain acts as the computing unit that integrates all the data and controls your actions.

In robotics, computing systems perform similar functions, enabling the robot to understand its environment, make decisions, and interact with its surroundings.

Let's proceed to understand the computing components equipped on the Duckiebot DB21 robot.
