## Computing - Introduction

What do we mean by computing?

Computing in robotics involves the processing of data, decision-making, and control. 
If we had to compare it a human analogy, computing is like the brain of a robot, responsible for interpreting information, making decisions, and executing actions.

In the context of robotics, computing systems are responsible for:

- Interpreting data from sensors and making decisions based on that data.
- Controlling actuators to perform desired actions.
- Running software that allows the robot to execute tasks autonomously.

Let's proceed to understand the computing components equipped on the Duckiebot DB21J robot.

### Jetson Nano

#### Description

The Jetson Nano is a powerful computing module designed by NVIDIA, specifically for AI and robotics applications.
The Duckiebot DB21J is equipped with a Jetson Nano, providing it with the computational power required for advanced tasks.  
The Jetson Nano operates as the central processing unit (CPU) of the Duckiebot, managing all computational tasks. 
With its quad-core ARM CPU and 128-core NVIDIA GPU, the Jetson Nano can handle complex computations, including real-time image processing and machine learning inference.  
It processes data from various sensors, runs algorithms for navigation and control, and executes the software that drives the robot's behavior.
