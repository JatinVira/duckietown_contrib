## Power - Introduction

What is Power?

Power in robotics refers to the energy source that drives all the electronic and mechanical components of the robot. 
It is the lifeblood of a robot, enabling it to perform tasks, operate sensors, run computing units, and actuate motors.

In the context of robotics, power systems are responsible for:

- Supplying the necessary energy to all components of the robot.
- Ensuring a stable and continuous power supply to maintain smooth operation.
- Managing energy consumption to optimize performance and extend operational time.

Let's take a simple example from our real world.
Imagine you are using a smartphone. Your phone's battery supplies the power needed to run applications, make calls, and perform other functions. In this scenario, the battery is analogous to the power system of a robot, providing the essential energy for operation.

In robotics, power systems play a crucial role in ensuring that the robot can perform its tasks efficiently and reliably.

Let's proceed to understand the power components equipped on the Duckiebot DB21 robot.
